# Hashmap

*Code-along for MCO 368 Data Structures II* 
* This program builds a [HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) from scratch to emphasize core concepts of a HashMap.  
* In this instance, the HashMap finds the definition value associated with its key word from a set of words defined in the dictionary.
